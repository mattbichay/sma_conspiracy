  "THREAD: What are the legal consequences of Trump\u2019s statements on Fox and Friends this morning? https://t.co/KfjnIGjSix",
  "1/ This morning, on Fox and Friends, Trump made a number of admissions that could create issues for him going forward. The first was his admission that Michael Cohen represented him with this \u201ccrazy Stormy Daniels deal.\u201d",
  "2/ That seems at odds with his prior statement that he didn\u2019t know anything about the Stormy Daniels payment or agreement. Why would you hire a lawyer to handle a matter but know nothing about the agreement that resulted from his representation? It\u2019s possible but hard to believe.",
  "3/ Trump\u2019s prior assertion that he knew nothing about the deal greatly undercut some of his arguments in the Daniels lawsuit, such as his argument that the case should be arbitrated, but it would have made it easier to avoid a deposition because he claimed no knowledge at all.",
  "4/ The seemingly inconsistent  statements could be used to undercut his credibility. In any event, it\u2019s now unclear what his position will be in the lawsuit going forward\u2014did he know about the Stormy Daniels agreement or not?",
  "5/ Trump also tried to distance himself from Cohen, claiming that handled \u201ca percentage of my overall legal work, a tiny, tiny little fraction.\u201d That could be inconsistent with Cohen\u2019s arguments in federal court that the FBI seized extensive attorney-client communications.",
  "6/ As a practical matter, although this was cited by federal prosecutors, it had little impact on the judge\u2019s ruling today appointing a special master, which was a very minor victory for Trump and Cohen. But it was a statement that appeared contrary to Trump\u2019s legal position.",
  "7/ Trump also said he was \u201cvery disappointed in my Justice Department ... I have decided that I won't be involved. I may change my mind at some point because what's going on is a disgrace.\u201d There was nothing to gain for him telegraphing his desire to interfere with the DOJ.",

  "7. If NY doesn't change the law, then the president would have to carefully time his pardon until *after* a jury is sworn in to inoculate Cohen and others from state charges. If he pardons before that, they would still be fair game for the AG.",

  "5. The key is that the statute is triggered once a jury in the federal case is sworn in. What the AG is arguing is that the statute makes several exceptions for when, even after that, the fed case doesn't come to fruition. He wants pardons to be added to that list of exceptions.",
