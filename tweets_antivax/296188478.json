  "Economists and big companies talking about GDP, investment and productivity hits from Brexit may sound big and national, but the reality is local impact. 27/",

  "The European Investment Bank, a source of cheaper and more available borrowing for public investment, will not be available. Funding for poorer regions through EU funds will be cut off, and history tells us that the UK govt will not replace it. 24/",
  "There is hardly a single \u2018local\u2019 issue that will not be adversely impacted by Brexit.  Schools, hospitals, colleges, roads, rubbish collection, street lighting, policing, parks, 1-to-1 services all rely on funding from tax or borrowing. 22/",
