  "3) Over the last month, I\u2019ve dug through thousands of government document pages and interviewed dozens of people. I found evidence of two things: over $100m in school safety funds that have gone unspent and policies that keep violent students (like 18-1958) out of jail.",
  "4) First, the money. In 2014, Broward Schools was given an $800m bond, with over $100m specifically for school safety. Since then, delays have led to only 5% of the money spent. Despite safety being the #1 priority of the bond, many projects were delayed to avoid increased cost.",
  "5) In a tweet, Superintendent @RobertwRuncie called our report \"fake news\" and suggested we contact @FloridaTaxWatch, an independent group tasked with helping to oversee the distribution of the money.

  "9) In a meeting with Runcie &amp; officials, I was told the system wasn't invented when the money was allocated and that it wasn't suggested until last year. However, the tech has existed since the 80s, and the Fmr Dir. of School Safety recommended a similar system years ago. https://t.co/fppWs1vN5K",

On the agreement's list, it says that if a crime constitutes a felony, the officer may \"consider\" placing the student under arrest. https://t.co/dFuJOkyo5J",
  "14) Even if students aren't enrolled in these programs, school admins aren't required to report potentially dangerous students to law enforcement. The current discipline matrix gives administration complete discretion to decide \"appropriate consequences\" for student misbehavior. https://t.co/YtoI4VEPJI",
  "16) More recently, two students from Flanagan High claimed that a fellow student was threatening to kill over 20 people. The student was briefly suspended and allowed to return back to campus alongside the students he threatened to kill. The list goes on. https://t.co/9FC8VoZkrI",
  "17) Similar to these incidents, 18-1958 was never arrested despite threatening to kill students, bringing bullets to school, and being involved in multiple fights. Had he been charged and convicted, he likely wouldn't have had access to weapons he used.",
  "19) Board Member @ReverendRos went as far as to suggest that our inquiry into these concerns was an exploitation of bloodshed for \"personal gain\". She's the same board member who removed her kids from the school district over \"safety concerns.\" https://t.co/on4nIjn5vZ",
