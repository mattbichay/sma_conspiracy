  "15) You say you believe in \"chain of command\" and note how you followed AG Lynch's instructions even on questionable issues (like that \"matter\"). How do you explain your contrasting dismissal of AG Sessions authority, and your decision to conceal vital information from him?",
  "13)Also on lying: FBI usually interviews witnesses up front, to see if they lie at start. Why did u not interview Clinton until after whole YEAR of work, and after you'd made judgement? U say impt FBI treats everyone same. Why all the special Hillary interview accomodations?",

  "11)You say what mattered was dossier's central \"premise\"--that Russia attempted to interfere in election. Can you name a time in modern history where Russia wasn't doing that? So why then give special credence to a politically motivated, salacious dossier?",
  "10)You admit dossier still \"unverified\" at the time you were fired. Yet you used specific unverified claims in it (Page) as basis of FISA warrant four times. Explain.",
  "9)You say nobody should ever lie to FBI. If Mr. Steele did lie, why has he not been prosecuted?",
  "8)The FBI must've known the fall news stories--particularly Yahoo News--came from Steele. Sourcing was obvious. Yet you told FISA court your \"credible\" source had not talked to media. Either u didn't follow up on stories before going to court, or Steele lied to you. Which?",
  "7)Steele (by his own admission) handed info to FBI and then briefed press--despite having been told not to Are these the actions of a \"credible\" source? Does it concern you that your \"credible\" source blew open to the public your investigation?",
  "6)You claim the \"effort\" was originally financed by a Republican source. You are aware, correct, that the actual dossier effort was only ever financed by the DNC and Clinton campaign?",
  "5) Did you ask Steele who had ultimately hired him? If he claimed to not know wouldn't that be worrisome--that a \"credible\" source (and former spy!) was willing to work for/benefit an unknown client? If by contrast he refused to tell you, doesn't that undercut credibility?",
  "4)You say you knew dossier was funded by a \"Democrat-aligned\" group but you never knew which one. Why on earth not? Did FBI truly not care where info came from? Who was paying for it? Doesn't this go direct to source credibility?",
  "3)Did you know Mr. Steele had been hired by Fusion GPS? Did FBI do any due diligence on Fusion, and discover its long record of being hired to dirty the reputations of its clients' political foes? If not, why not?",
  "2)You repeatedly note the \"source\" of the dossier (Steele) was \"credible.\" Does the FBI routinely view as \"credible\" sources hired by political operatives? You say Steele had a \"track record\" but did fact he was now working for politicals--in an election year--not concern you?",
